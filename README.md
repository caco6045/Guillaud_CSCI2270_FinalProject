# Guillaud_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This project will be a connect four game, consisting of a 6 by 7 board and allowing two players to play on their turn. The structure that will take care of remembering the position of each of the player tokens will consist of a linked list with different pointers: top, bottom, right, left and key. Everytime a column is chosen by a player, the program will find the lowest open slot in that column, set the key as 1 or 2, depending on the turn of the player, and will check if 4 tokens are connected by checking the node->bottom, node->top, node->right, node->left along with a combination of those such as node->top->left. Once the game is finished, the players will have to option to play again or quit the game. If they decided to play again, the player who won gets one point.
